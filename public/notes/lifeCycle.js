// constructor = Enter the restaurant and ask for the buffet (happens once per component instance /once every time we use the component in JSX) 

// render = Collect food from the buffet (can happen multiple times, for example, if the props keep changing, the render will happen every time they change)

// The DOM is updated = Eat the food
// This isn't a life-cycle method, but it is part of the life-cycle

// componentDidMount = Ask for condiments, tap water, more cutlery (could happen multiple times. for example, conditional rendering, where props change the component from rendered to not rendered)

// componentWillUnmount = Pay the bill and leave
